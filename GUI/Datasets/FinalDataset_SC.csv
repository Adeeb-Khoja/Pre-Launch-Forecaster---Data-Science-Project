vehicles first off i love the way this car looks i considered it cosmetically flawless for an  truck shines like a pretty penny it came with  row seats and  row entertainment dvd center ive owned  bmw sedans in the past and loved it in the first  months ive noticed few things power steering was a bit heavy  row seat is extremely tight with leg room but at least we have it no spare tire with  row option which was expected but they dont even have a jack once the  months passed the problems begins it has been continuing issues after issues that never ends ive owned this truck for a year now and put on less than  miles on it and its time to get rid of it before it becomes more of a money pit something about the yaw control that makes the vehicle jerk during take off from a dead stop when the car is still cold in the first  mins of driving it passenger acheater vent motor grinds inside the dash when turning or making a right turn now the passenger climate control only blows warm air even when the ac is in full blast but the driver side blows cold air suspension deflates over night and you can hear the pump running when you first open the door to inflate it and level the rear of the car now it deflates after it sat for about  hours driver passenger led tail light went out no way to fix it but replace the whole tail light assembly dvd navigations takes a long time to load and it gets really warm rear camera clarity is soo poor that at night it was unuseable it started leaking oil came to find out the head gasket needed to be replaced while replacing the head gasket the brittle breather hose needed to be replace because it was guarantee to be broken when you have to take this hose out to remove the head gasket it never ran the same since then rough idles when its cold for about  seconds then it was fine now the water pump is out and recommeded to replace the thermostat while its being fix the water pump is plastic electric design and the thermostat is also enclosed in plastic housing assembly and the location of the water pump and thermostat is impossible to get to that you have to remove the wheels and wheel well to give a little more room to get to it  for the water pump  for the thermostat  magnesium mounting bolts that needed to be replaced and cannot be reused and  hours of labor at  right stage two brake light keeps coming on ive replaced all the bulbs and still comes on intermittently lastly the truck goes to neutral from drive position when you just started moving from a complete stop in the middle of the street while the engine is still running you cannot just throw it back into drive you need to press the brake pedal turn it off and restart the car to put it back in drive it happened  to  times so far when my wife was driving it and was afraid that she would get rear ended cus other drivers doesnt know that your car just stopped in neutral position huge safety issue called bmw and ofcourse you know the answer to this this is the first time they are hearing about it when hundreds of others online experiencing the same problems with this safety issue no oil dip stick computer monitors shows how much oil you have no engine temp

perfect car has a few quirks though this is a brandnew car for me and the year or so ive owned it now i have to say that the reliability has been fantastic so far  no problems to speak of drove a lot  miles so far had one service and still going strongthe good stuffas far as a driving machine goes this car is very hard to fault  coming from a manual transmission car i was afraid i was going to lose some of that sporty fun of shifting gears but this has a very good selectshift automatic that is fast and doesnt nanny you too bad  the push forward for downshifts and push back for upshifts is also more akin to racing cars which is great  the most amazing thing about this car is definitely the fuel efficiency  for my mix of commuting of road trips im averaging about  mpg which is about the same i got with my old mark v gti which is a  compact car  the fact that i can get that kind of mpg of a car so heavy and powerful is nothing short of amazing  a large thanks to this is the  speed transmission which barely spins the engine when you are in top gear on the highway and still lets you have some lowend power for gentle passing  besides that it holds corners very well brakes well and acceleration is very strong when you need it  itll happily cruise at around  mph and when passing itll reach up to  or so without much trouble  one of my favorite things is that when you are in drive and push shifter to the manual mode itll automatically shift down two gears as though it knows you are trying to pass on a narrow road  even in comfort mode the ride is quite firm  a lot of people associate luxury cars with plush rides and supreme quiet  this is not that car this is for someone who enjoys driving and feeling the road for sure  its a refined ride for sure so you dont feel fatigued even after many hours of driving  its also got a huge gas tank so you dont have to stop and fill up too often  miles per fillup the steering is electric and takes some getting used to i thing but once you do you dont really think about its little weirdnesses too much  the space is immense and it has a lot of storage for items and various small knickknacksbesides that its got all the standard luxury car fare like rain sensing wipers bright headlights seat memory electronic trunk close backup camera and all that  they all work as they should but the seat memory is particularly notable in that it memorizes the position of the side mirrors as well which i feel is the most difficult thing to get rightthe badfor as much as i like the car there are a few things that are annoying  the first is the looks while i like it i liked the previous generation better it was more aggressive and masculine  the  one looks a little more subdued and feminine  the driving is great but its so heavy and has so many gears that the engine braking is not great on moderate downhills  the only other thing i wish could be improved with the driving experience are the automatic headlights  it seems to come on when it is almost totally dark i wish it would come on sooner  ive also yet to find a why to prevent the air conditioning to stop turning itself on when you start the car on a hot day  this means im constantly turning it off  like many german cars its also a huge hypochondriac in that it tells you to pull over and go to a dealership even when a tire has slightly low pressure due to cold weather  that is very annoying and alarming when you are trying to just drive casually somewhere      when it comes to the idrive  the only good thing about the map is how you can instantly zoom in and out with the use of the track wheel thingy but the routes are really dimwitted  the new letter tracking input is just not easier than the normal track wheel letter selection  its just too hard to get right at  mph  the iphoneipod integration is also bad because it is meant to be universal so it works like a really dimwitted file directory sort of system so you cant do advanced features specific to your device  im also really disappointed the stereo has no midrange control it has a great set of speakers but its hard to get the midrange out for surethe primary reason i chose the  over its direct competitors the lexus rx acura mdx audi  mercedes m class porsche cayenne etc is that l preferred the look of the exterior and interior over all the others  having had a bmw in europe i knew what to expect with the driving experience  what i wasnt prepared for coming from a vw to a this car in america at least is just how hated you can be in the real world  people seem much less likely to let you pass on a highway let you merge and let you out of side turns  i thought it was imagination but even my wife noticed that she is definitely treated differently in this car that our

SUV",cpo purchase no big complaints but updated we wanted to buy a new one in  but they were just a little too high for anything but a diesel and we were wary of diesel price swings the different character of that engine and being able to pull into a pump anywhere at a busy station back when diesel was less common   years later we found that many diesel versions had reliability issues    but in terms of allaround ability ride handling acceleration comfort utility towing ability looks it was still our favorite  years later  it handles fantastic for such a large heavy vehicle  you can feel the weight but the huge tires grip like crazy  the sav version is definitely the one to get it looks great and gives a feeling of confidence in turns and at speed that most others just do not   utility is good not great with over  cu ft of cargo area with seats down  they dont fold flat which is disappointing we have dogs but there is plenty of room for a road trip with  dogs  people and luggage   a family of four would do ok  it can also tow a fairly heavy trailer but i installed my own hitch and wiring as the bmw version is outrageously expensive  took  hours so theres no valid reason for their exorbitant labor charges as they should be able to do it in half the time  ride is firm but not harsh though big bumps will be felt   it is a better ride than our volvo  r design sport sedan but those seeking a luxury smooth ride should look elsewhere   it is surprisingly quiet for a vehicle like this  seat comfort is better for the thin shouldered as the bolsters do press a little on my broad back at the lats  the thigh extension is a musthave  xenons make visibilty good at night and there are no blind spots to worry about   throttle tip in is actually slower than it should be you have to punch it to get power in regular transmission mode  it doesnt seem to be turbo lag max torque comes in at just  rpm but a throttle tip in issue  acceleration is good not breathtaking but more than enough for regular driving especially at speed  handling is very confidence inspiring and curvy mountain roads wont raise the hairs on your back like in most crossovers or suvs  not too far from a sport sedan and better than most mundane sedans   very handsome vehicle materials are good and our  year old example looked practically new   many others we looked at didnt fare so well  we paid  for one with  miles and it still has one year of bumper to bumper and  more years of cpo coverage   with taxes and the hitch we have  in it  it stickered for about  so thats a nice savings   it had an airbag recall that was fixed before we got it but otherwise the history was clean   there was no spare on this one which is unfortunate but those temp spares are so limited in range and speed that it wasnt of much use anyway on long trips   the interior design is handsome but not beautiful  ergonomics are typical bmw with a learning curve for some functions like cruise and the computer  the nav is useful but like most not always great  the idrive controller is fairly easy to use now and fairly logical though one can still get screens not doing what you want when choosing the split screen or wanting to display your songs when you are also navigating etc   tons of brake dust like all bmws  but a very solid feeling vehicle and great build quality  conceptually this is the closest to a does it all vehicle that one can find    sporty good lookingin sav trim good handling quiet reasonable ride quality safe spacious and  reasonable comfort    my only fix would be to add the luxury comfort seat option as the sport seats are supportive but a little firm compared to our volvos  but anything will be less comfortable than volvo seats    only those who value solid handling and sporty aspirations should bother paying the price as there are plenty of bigger or more cushy rides available for less  we just want the confidence it gives at high speed and the active safety of great handling and braking for the classupdate   steering is actually overheavy in parking situations the wide tires and heavy steering actually make your arms ache while backing a trailer    it feels as heavy as it is and so unless you need the extra space the  is probably a better choice for driving enthusiasts but really a wagon would be best of all unfortunately they make only the  series wagon and i find its seats too narrow the  seats are wide    its very solid at speed but not nimble   update   actually it handles very well but in a heavy manner  ride is for enthusiasts rather than luxury seekers  depreciation has been really bad as apparently bmws reliability and high cost of repairs haunt it   a good bargain well researched  vehicle has a resale value
